    Hi, I am Adam! I am a software developer, recently learning more about Python. I graduated System Engineering on Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska in 2015.
    I have worked in a big corporation with an international team, but it is time for me to move on to the next challenge.
    I enjoy problem solving involving programming, data manipulation as well as long walks with my dogs.
